    <h2>A list of some films I like.</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>Dune (parts 1 and 2)</h3>
            <p>Well-paced, beautiful films with particularly good direction from Denis Villeneuve.</p>
        <h3>LotR trilogy</h3>
            <p>Absolute classics. Epic and immersive.</p>
        <h3>The Green Knight</h3>
            <p>An odd medieval fantasy film,  adapted from the 14th-century poem "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". Difficult to follow, but I was interested all the way through.</p>
